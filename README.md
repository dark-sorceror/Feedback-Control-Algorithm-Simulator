# Motion Algorithm Simulator
---

## Overview 
This repository made by VEX Robotics team 3388N Nova showcases a variety of autonomous motion algorithms used for path generation, control, tracking, and optimization including algorithms like RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) and Pure Pursuit. These algorithms are simulated to demonstrate their application in autonomous navigation, covering key aspects of motion planning, trajectory following, and feedback control.

All of these algorithms were implemented through VEX Robotics, and is a educational resource for other teams learning about autonomous motion to boost efficiency and accuracy while meeting objectives during autonomous periods in a match and achieving a high score in skills routine.

## Features
Simulations of Key Algorithms:
- RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) for obstacle-avoidance path planning.
- Pure Pursuit for dynamic path tracking.
- PID Control for fine-tuned motion control and stability.
- Kalman Filters for enhanced state estimation in noisy environments.
